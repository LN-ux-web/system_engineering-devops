# 0x02. Shell, I/O Redirections and filters

This directory contains scripts for learning shell input/output redirection and command filtering in Bash.

Each script demonstrates the use of commands like `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `echo`, and `find`, along with redirection operators such as `>`, `>>`, and pipelines `|`.

All scripts start with `#!/bin/bash` and are executable.
